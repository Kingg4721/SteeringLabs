# SteeringLabs
SteeringLab is a Unity project focused on implementing and experimenting with steering behaviors for autonomous agents. It includes scenes dedicated to missiles, flocking, and intermittent movement (jellyfish), allowing for testing, comparing, and studying different navigation and AI behaviors.
